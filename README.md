# Fresh Graduated in Geodetic Engineering 

#### Let me introduce my self

I am a Geodetic Engineering graduate (Bachelor's Degree) with a strong academic and practical foundation in geospatial science. I have developed hands-on skills in GIS, remote sensing, and land surveying. I am proficient in using geospatial software such as ArcGIS, QGIS, Google Earth Engine, AutoCAD, Agisoft Metashape, and Python for spatial data processing, analysis, and visualization. My technical competencies also include operating surveying instruments such as waterpass, theodolite, total station, and GNSS to support accurate field data collection and mapping.
